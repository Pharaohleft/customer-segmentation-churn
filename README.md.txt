# Customer Segmentation, LTV Prediction & Churn Analysis

This project applies advanced analytics and machine learning to identify high-value customers, predict churn, forecast future purchases, and inform strategic decision-making. It’s based on the Online Retail II dataset and integrates exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Highlights
✅ Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis  
✅ LTV Prediction for 6-month forecasting  
✅ Churn Prediction with XGBoost  
✅ Next Purchase Prediction  
✅ Sales Forecasting using LSTM

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Data visualization and feature engineering
- SQL for data manipulation

## Dataset
- Online Retail II dataset from UCI and Kaggle


## Learning Outcomes
- End-to-end ML pipeline development
- Business insights from customer behavior data
